 * ## Description:
   The program uses python hashlib to hash strings provided by
   user at runtime.
   The code not only hashes the string but also cracks them
   using bruteforce technique.In order to check what type of
   hash you want to decrypt , run the hash against the program:
   'hashidentifier' to determine the type and save lots of time.
